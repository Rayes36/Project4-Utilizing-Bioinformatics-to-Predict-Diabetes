# Project4-Utilizing-Bioinformatics-to-Predict-Diabetes
In this project we've made an unpublished paper about this model. the model uses 5 machine learning models-Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, Ensemble Model (Voting Classifier)-to predict whether a patient has diabetes or not based on these factors-ï»¿Pregnancies, Glucose, Blood Pressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction, Age. The dataset used in this project is https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/whenamancodes/predict-diabities
